# Backlog

Ideas, optimizations, and future considerations. Not urgent — revisit when time allows.

## Ideas

- [ ] **Use cheaper/faster models for subagents.** Entity resolver, config validator, and other subagents may work fine with Haiku or lower temperature settings. Could reduce cost and latency significantly (e.g., resolver went from 54s to 24s just by fixing docs — model choice could cut further). Need to investigate whether Claude Code plugin agents support model/temperature overrides in frontmatter.
