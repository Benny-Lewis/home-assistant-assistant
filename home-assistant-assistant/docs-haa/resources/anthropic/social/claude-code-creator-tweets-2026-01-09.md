- @bcherny: "Slash commands and skills have been merged in practice for a while now -- they're the same thing in practice."
- @bcherny: "Totally. Skills are usually invoked by the model, slash commands by the user. But we see people write more and more of each the line honestly gets pretty blurry. We think the model will do most of the invocation soon and are simplifying the system a bit in prep for that."
- @bcherny: "That's a bug, fix incoming."
- @bcherny: "yeah they're the same thing."
- @bcherny: "Yep! user-invocable: false."
- @bcherny: "Yep! I try to stick to 'skill' but either works."
